  <h1> About Me </h1>
  <p style="text-align:justify;"> I'm a curious <b>data-enthusiast</b> who is passionate about <b>innovation</b>, entrepreneurial strategy and <b>story-telling</b>.I was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey. Exploring new topics, cultures and places feed my soul. I traveled more than 30 countries, met and collaborated with many different people. Experiencing diversity help me to understand how people think and how they communicate their needs.</p> <br>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">  As entrepreneurship lies in my nature, I like to ideate solutions to the <b>pain points and needs</b> of the people, whether it is a social or business problem. When finding a solution, I prefer to do quantitative analysis, to make the right decision and to be able to see mutliple scenarios clearly. As data is at the heart of the quantitative analysis, I decided to learn about data tools (R, Python, SQL, Excel). Theese tools combined with my analytical mindset, help me to overcome challenges more effectively and leverage the story-telling by using <b>interactive plots</b> and <b>dashboards</b>. If you are interested in my approach, please feel free to look at my projects! (I <span class="love">‚ù§</span> Plotly!). </p>
