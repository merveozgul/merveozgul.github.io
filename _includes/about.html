  <h1> About Me </h1>
  <p> I'm a curious data-enthusiast who is passionate about innovation, entrepreneurial strategy and story-telling.I was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey. Exploring new topics, cultures, food feed my soul. I traveled more than 30 countries, met and collaborated with lots of different people. Experiencing diversity help me to understand how people think and how they communicate their needs.</p> <br>
  <p>  As entrepreneurship lies in my nature, I like to ideate solutions to the pain points and needs of the people, whether it is a social or business problem. When finding a solution, I prefer to do quantitative analysis, to make the right decision and to be able to see mutliple scenarios clearly. As data is at the heart of the quantitative analysis, I decided to learn about data science tools (R, Python, SQL). Theese tools combined with my analytical mindset, help me to overcome challenges more effectively and leverage the story-telling by using interactive plots and dashboards. If you are interested in my approach, please feel free to look at my projects! (I <span class="love">‚ù§</span> Plotly!). </p>
